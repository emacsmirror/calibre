* Allow viewing the queue of calibredb jobs
If a large number of library modifications is started they will
potentially take a long time to complete.  When this is the case it
may be desirable to have listing of the remaining jobs so that the
user can see that progress is being made.

* Decide what to do about metadata edit buffers when library is switched
The current implementation of metadata editing relies on the
assumption that the active library is not changed while a metadata
editing buffer is open.  If changes to metadata are applied after such
a switch the book with the same ID in the new library will be
modified.  This is far from desirable but it is not clear what the
best course of action in this scenario is.

* Allow exporting catalogues
Calibre allows exporting a catalogue of a library, or some subset of
the library, in various formats.  calibre.el should be able to do this
to.

* Allow converting between formats
It should be possible to convert a book, or multiple books, between
formats from the *Library* buffer.

* Make calibre-library prompt for the library when called with a prefix argument

* Allow mass editing of metadata
It should be possible to mark a set of books and apply a change, such
as adding tags or setting a publisher, to to all of them.

* Allow modifying publication date
